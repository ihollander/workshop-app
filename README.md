# Workshop App

Code to generate React workshops. Inspired by Kent C Dodd's
[workshop app](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-workshop-app).

## Generating New Workshops

To create a new workshop from a template, run:

```sh
npx create-react-app workshop-name --use-npm --template @ihollander/cra-template-flatiron-workshop
```

This will create a new workshop repo with some starter code and all the
necessary dependencies. It also provides a README with student-facing
instructions for getting the workshop set up locally.

> NOTE: The script above uses npm instead of yarn as the default package
> installer. There are some dependency issues with yarn that need some further
> investigation; in the meantime, npm works just fine.

## Workshop Features

In the workshop repo, the folder structure looks like this:

```txt
.
├── public
└── src
    ├── __tests__
    │   └── 01.test.js
    ├── exercise
    │   ├── 01.js
    │   ├── 01.md
    │   ├── 02.html
    │   └── 02.md
    ├── solution
    │   ├── 01.extra-1.js
    │   ├── 01.js
    │   └── 02.html
    ├── index.js
    └── setupTests.js
```

Under the hood, the workshop repo uses code from
[https://github.com/ihollander/workshop-app](https://github.com/ihollander/workshop-app)
to generate routes for each exercise based on the filenames in the
`src/exercise` and `src/solution` folder. You'll see the `workshop-app` code
referenced in `src/index.js`.

## Adding Exercises

To add new exercises, create the following file using the following naming
convention/folder structure:

- `src/exercises/03.md`: a readme for the exercise.
- `src/exercises/03.js`: starter code for a React exercise. **You must have one
  default export in this file!**.
- `src/exercises/03.html`: starter code for a Javascript exercise. You should
  include any HTML, CSS and JavaScript code as inline scripts.
- `src/solutions/03.js` (optional, but encouraged): solution code for the
  exercise.
- `src/solutions/03.extra-1.js` (optional): extra credit solution code. You can
  add multiple extra credit solutions, if you like, by following the naming
  convention `{exercise}.extra-{number}.js`.
- `src/__tests__/03.test.js` (optional): test code for the exercise.

The workshop app makes certain assumptions about your code based on the file
type:

- **md** files will be used for READMEs
- **js** files will be used for React exercises (and must `export default` a
  component)
- **html** files will be used for JavaScript exercises (and must include all
  necessary HTML, CSS and JS within the file)

You'll need to restart the app any time you add a new file (otherwise, changes
to the files will hot reload as normal).

## Student Setup

The main README.md file in the workshop repo generated by the template has the
setup instructions for students to follow. You can also send students this
video, which has the setup instructions as well as a walkthrough of the features
of the workshop:
