# Theming

To help style components consistently, and to make it easy to change the look
and feel of multiple components, we can use the `ThemeProvider` component from
`styled-components`. The `ThemeProvider` component gives all `styled-components`
access to a special `theme` prop, which can be used for custom styles.

```js render=true live=true
import styled, { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";

const Button = styled.button`
  background: ${props => props.theme.primary};
  color: ${props => props.theme.fontColor};
  border: none;
  padding: 1rem;
  font-size: 1em;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
`;

const theme1 = {
  primary: "dodgerblue",
  fontColor: "white",
};

const theme2 = {
  primary: "deeppink",
  fontColor: "black",
};

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme1}>
      <Button>I can use the theme!</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

render(<App />);
```

## Exercise

This setup also makes it easy to switch between themes by using _state_! In the
example code, we have two basic themes set up &mdash; a `lightTheme` and a
`darkTheme`. See if you can change the theme by clicking on a button.

You'll need to keep track of which theme is selected using the `useState` hook,
and find a way to change themes by setting state when the buttons are clicked.
